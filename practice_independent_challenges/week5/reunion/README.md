## Tasks

We're developing a small application to split expenses after a group of friends get together for a reunion. This will track how much each person spent on a particular activity, how much each person owed, and ultimately print out a summary of how much each person owes or is owed. Use tests to drive your development.

### Iteration 1: Creating Activities

Use TDD to create an Activity class that responds to the following interaction pattern.

For the `add_participant` method, the first argument represents the name of someone who participated in the activity, and the second argument represents how much they paid for the activity.

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/activity'
# => true

pry(main)> activity = Activity.new("Brunch")
# => #<Activity:0x007fe4ca1df568 ...>

pry(main)> activity.name
# => "Brunch"

pry(main)> activity.participants
# => {}

pry(main)> activity.add_participant("Maria", 20)

pry(main)> activity.participants
# => {"Maria" => 20}

pry(main)> activity.total_cost
# => 20

pry(main)> activity.add_participant("Luther", 40)

pry(main)> activity.participants
# => {"Maria" => 20, "Luther" => 40}

pry(main)> activity.total_cost
# => 60
```

### Iteration 2: Activity Calculations and creating Reunions

Use TDD to update the Activity class so that it responds to the following interaction pattern.

For the `split` method, it is assumed that the cost is evenly distributed amongst participants. It should be the total cost divided by the number of participants.

For the `owed` method, the amount each person owes is the difference between what they paid and the `split`. If a participant paid less than their fair share they owe a positive amount. If a participant paid more than their fair share they owe a negative amount (meaning they are owed money).

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/activity'
# => true

pry(main)> activity = Activity.new("Brunch")
# => #<Activity:0x007fe4ca1df568 ...>

pry(main)> activity.add_participant("Maria", 20)

pry(main)> activity.add_participant("Luther", 40)

pry(main)> activity.total_cost
# => 60

pry(main)> activity.split
# => 30

pry(main)> activity.owed
# => {"Maria" => 10, "Luther" => -10}
```

Additionaly, use TDD to create a Reunion class that responds to the following interaction pattern:

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/reunion'
# => true

pry(main)> reunion = Reunion.new("1406 BE")
# => #<Reunion:0x007fe4ca1defc8 ...>

pry(main)> reunion.name
# => "1406 BE"

pry(main)> reunion.activities
# => []

pry(main)> activity_1 = Activity.new("Brunch")
# => #<Activity:0x007fe4ca1d9438 ...>

pry(main)> reunion.add_activity(activity_1)

pry(main)> reunion.activities
# => [#<Activity:0x007fe4ca1d9438 ...>]
```

### Iteration 3: Reunion Calculations

Use TDD to update your Reunion class to respond to the following interaction pattern.

* Each `Reunion` can tell us the total cost of the event. #total_cost
* Each `Reunion` can tell us each participant's name and what they owe for the whole reunion. This should be the combination of what they owe from all activities. Again, a negative value means they are owed money. For example, if `"Maria"` owes 10 from brunch and is owed 20 from bouncy castle, her final amount owed in the breakout is -10. #split
* Each `Reunion` can print a summary of each participant's name and what they owe, separated by a line break.


### Iteration 4: Detailed Breakout

* Each `Reunion` can give us a detailed breakout (in addition to the breakout from iteration 3). This detailed breakout should tell us each participant's name, as well as info for each activity they participated in including a list of the people who owe them for the activity if they are owed money, or a list of the people who they owe if they owe money, along with the amount they owe or are owed.
