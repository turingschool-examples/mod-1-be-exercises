# Problem #1: 
# Get a unique list of all of the cities that these humans have lived in  
# ["Philadelphia", "Fort Collins", "Seattle", "Denver", "Santa Fe", "Portland", "Lansing", "Columbus", "Austin"]




# Problem #2: 
# Write code that iterates through the `cities_lived_in` hash, and returns a list of  
# names of the humans who've lived in Philadelphia.

# [:michaela, :mike, :alex]
# or
# ["Michaela", "Mike", "Alex"]




# Problem #3: 
# Create a hash that has the city as a key, and the number of people that live in it as it's value: 

# {
#     "Philadelphia" => 3,
#     "Fort Collins" => 1,
#     "Seattle" =>2,
#     "Denver" => 1,
#     "Santa Fe" => 1,
#     "Portland" => 1,
#     "Lansing" => 1,
#     "Columbus => 1,
#     "Austin" => 1
# }
