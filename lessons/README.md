# Lessons

Here you will find the starter code for many of your lessons. Often, instructors will do code-alongs during lessons, and it can be helpful to follow along and take notes of your own.

Each folder is for a particular lesson and topic. Most of these will contain a README as well to give further instruction on how to best use these resources. Often, there will be extra practice not covered during lessons in these folders as well. This is a great first place to look if you feel you need more practice on a topic.
