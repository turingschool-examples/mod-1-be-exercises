# Scope Exercise

The `painter_spec.rb` file contains tests that may or may not have some scope issues. Some will throw errors, some will fail, and some may run without failure. For each test:
1. Read the test and relevant files in the `lib` directory
1. Try to predict what output the test will produce
1. Unskip the test and run the test file
1. See if the output was what you expected
1. Add the skip back into the test so that you only see output from one test at a time.
