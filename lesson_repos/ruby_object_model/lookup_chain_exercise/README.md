# Ruby Lookup Chain Exercise

## Activity 1

Examine the code in this repository and diagram the Object Model for a `Chair` instance.

## Activity 2

The `Chair` class has several superclasses and modules where Ruby can look for methods. At the bottom of the `chair.rb` file, a new instance of chair is created and the `chair_type` method is called on that instance. Your job is to comment out sections of the code in order to get `chair_type` to print each of the following:

1. "method"
1. "class"
1. "module"
1. "superclass"
1. "superclass's module"
1. "superclass's superclass"
